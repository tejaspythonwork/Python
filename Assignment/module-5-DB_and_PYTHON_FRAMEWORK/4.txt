Q4: what is django url make a project to create django urls
Ans:


urls.py
-------

urlpatterns = [
    path('register/',views.view_courses,name='reg'),
]

according to urls.py we have to import 
1.views
2.path

mainly 2 imports are necessary

views.py
-------

after that we have to create view which has same name as 
we have specified in path

example 0f views
*****
def view_courses(request):
    # for popular courses
    try:
        course = Courses.objects.all()
        stud = Student.objects.get(email=request.session['email'])
        context = {
            'course':course,
            'stud' : stud
        }
        print('---------')
        print(course.id)
        for i in course:
            print(i.course_name)
        return render(request,'myapp/courses.html',context)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    return render(request,'myapp/courses.html',context)


html page:(named as courses.html):
****
we have to write complete html page and specify 
parameters accordingly to that particular views
